# 1. Introduction to Clinical Trials and Drug Development

# Clinical Trials (1 of 3)

Clinical trial<sup>1</sup> -- a research study conducted to assess the _**utility**_ of an 
_**intervention in volunteers**_

- _**Utility**_: safety, tolerability, efficacy, risk/benefit ratio

- _**Interventions**_ can be: drugs, biologics, medical devices, methods of screening, novel surgical procedures, novel therapies, etc.

- _**Volunteers**_: Humans (healthy volunteers or patients with a disease of interest)

# Clinical Trials (2 of 3)

Since clinical trials are experiments in humans, special considerations related to medical ethics and protection of study subjects apply:

- The Nuremberg Code (1949)
- The Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and beyond)
    + _**The well-being of subjects taking part in research should take precedence over the interest of science and society**_
- The Belmont Report (1979) 
    + _**A statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines: Respect for Persons, beneficence, and Justice**_
- Code of Federal Regulation (US FDA)
    + 21 CRF Part 50 -- Protection of Human Subjects, Informed Concent
    + 21 CRF Part 56 -- Standards for Institutional Review Boards
    + 45 CRF Part 46 -- Protection of human research subjects, including pregannt women, prisoners, and children
- International Conference on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practices (ICH GCP) (1990 and beyond)

# Clinical Trials (3 of 3)

Three important principles in clinical trial design methodology:

--

1. _**Randomization**_ -- generation of sequence of treatment assignments by means of some known random mechanism (e.g. by coin flip):
  
  + helps mitigate various experimental biases; promote "comparability" of treatment groups; can form the basis for statistical inference;

--

2. _**Blinding**_ -- a process that attempts to keep the treatment assignments not known or easily ascertained:
  
  + helps mitigate ascertainment bias (systematic distortions due to the knowledge of which intervention the patient is receiving);
  
--

3. _**Use of Control Group**_ -- a group of patients treated with a "standard of care", which serves as the reference for treatment comparisons:
  
  + allows discrimination of patient outcomes caused by the test treatment from outcomes caused by other factors (such as the natural progression of the disease, observer of patient expectations, or other treatment);

An "ideal" design is 

- _**randomized**_, 

- _**double-blinded**_,

- placebo-and/or active-_**controlled**_ clinical trial.

# Clinical Development (1 of 3)

The essence of rational drug development is _**to ask important questions**_ and _**to answer them with appropriate studies**_.

Four types of clinical studies (according to their objectives)<sup>2</sup>:

1. _**Human pharmacology**_ -- to assess safety and tolerability, define/describe PK and PD, explore drug metabolism and interactions, estimate activity.

2. _**Therapeutic exploratory**_ -- proof-of-concept studies to explore drug use in the targeted indication; calibrate dose regimens.

3. _**Therapeutic confirmatory**_ -- demonstrate/confirm efficacy, establish safety profile, assess benefit/risk and establish dose-response relationship.

4. _**Therapeutic use**_ -- refine understanding of benefit/risk, refine dosing, identify less common adverse reactions.

# Clinical Development (2 of 3)

Clinical development is ideally a logical, step-wise procedure in which information from small early studies is used to support and plan later larger, more definitive studies<sup>3</sup>.

# Clinical Trial Design: Basic Elements

Traditionally, a clinical trial process consists of 4 steps:

1. Design

2. Conduct

3. Analysis

4. Interpretation and dissemination of the results

In this course, we will primarily focus on the _**design**_ part.

---

# Clinical Trial Design: Main Considerations

Clinical trial team (medical lead, biostatistician, PK scientist, etc.) develops _**clinical trial protocol**_ which contains the following important information:

&nbsp;1. _**Clear formulation of study objectives**_:
  + e.g., to test that experimental drug results in greater reduction in total cholesterol level than standard of care.

--

&nbsp;2. _**Type of a design**_:
  + e.g., parallel group, crossover, factorial, dose escalation, enrichment, group sequential, or adaptive design.

--

&nbsp;3. _**Primary research hypothesis (for confirmatory trials) **_:
  + test for equality, superiority, non-inferiority, or equivalence.

---

# Clinical Trial Design: Main Considerations

Clinical trial team (medical lead, biostatistician, PK scientist, etc.) develops _**clinical trial protocol**_ which contains the following important information:

&nbsp;4. _**Study endpoints (outcome variables)**_
  + Normal, binary, count, or time-to-event

--

&nbsp;5. _**Choice of control group**_
  + Placebo control, active control, or multiple controls

--

&nbsp;6. _**Study population**_
  + Normal healthy volunteers, patients, or special population (e.g. pediatric or geriartric patients)
    
---

# Clinical Trial Design: Statistical Considerations

_**Biostatistician**_ is tasked with providing input on the following:

- Sample size

- Treatment allocation ratio

- Randomization procedure to implement the desired allocation

- Measures to protect study from bias (blinding, allocation concealment)

- Statistical methodology to analyze data
